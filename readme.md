# Weather App

Welcome to the Weather App, a user-friendly application that allows you to fetch real-time weather details for any city around the globe. This project is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and serves as a practical example of how to integrate APIs into a web application.

## Features

- **Global Weather Data**: Access up-to-date weather information for any city worldwide.
- **Responsive Design**: Enjoy a seamless experience on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **API Integration**: Learn how to fetch and display data from a weather API in a real-world scenario.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Easily search for cities and view detailed weather statistics, including temperature, humidity, and weather conditions.

## Purpose

The main objective of creating this application was to explore and demonstrate the practical use of APIs in web development. By building this app, I've gained hands-on experience in:
- Making API calls using JavaScript
- Handling asynchronous operations
- Parsing and displaying JSON data
- Enhancing user interaction with dynamic content updates

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Structuring the web application
- **CSS**: Styling the application for an appealing look and responsive design
- **JavaScript**: Implementing the core functionality and API integration

## Getting Started

To run this application locally, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash

2. Open index.html in your web browser.
3. Enter the name of any city to get the current weather details.

## Future Enhancements

- **Enhanced UI/UX**: Improve the visual design and user experience.
- **Additional Data**: Display more detailed weather information such as forecasts and wind speeds
- **Error Handling**: Implement more robust error handling for better user feedback
